# ENCOR 350-401 — Two-Pass Study Plan

**Goal:** Deep working knowledge for production use. Exam-readiness is a side-effect, not the primary driver.  
**Time budget:** ~2 hours/day, irregular. Some days nothing — that's fine, the structure absorbs it.  
**Total duration:** ~24–26 weeks across two passes.  
**Video spine:** CBT Nuggets / Jeff Kish (primary — concepts, big picture, self-check quizzes) + INE legacy CCIE-style courses (secondary — protocol depth and Wireshark-level detail).  
**Labs:** GNS3vault archive (René Molenaar) for all classical topics + hand-written EVE-NG labs for modern topics (VXLAN, LISP, NETCONF, Ansible).  
**Reference:** OCG 2nd edition (Hucaby et al.) — used in Pass 2 for slow re-reads, not as primary source in Pass 1.

---

## How the two passes differ

| | Pass 1 (~14 weeks) | Pass 2 (~10 weeks) |
|---|---|---|
| **Goal** | Build the mental map. See everything once. | Harden what you saw. Fix the gaps. |
| **CBT** | Primary — watch first for concepts and big picture | Only for topics where INE didn't click |
| **INE** | Secondary — watch after CBT for protocol depth | Re-watch only weak modules |
| **Labs** | None. Zero. Resist the urge. | All labs, in order, GNS3vault first |
| **OCG** | Skim only — 1 pass through chapter summary sections | Slow re-read of every chapter you struggled with |
| **Notes** | 3–5 bullets per topic from memory after both videos | Full notes in your own words, "things I got wrong" subsection |
| **Anki** | None | Build deck from Pass 2 notes, review daily |
| **Pace** | Flexible — topic takes 9 days instead of 7? Fine. | More structured — use the weekly shape as a target |

**Why no labs in Pass 1:** Labs demand that you already have a rough mental model of what you're trying to build. Without it, you spend 80% of your lab time confused about *what* to type rather than *why* it works. The confusion is not productive — it's just frustrating. Pass 2 labs will go dramatically faster because you've already seen the topology and the commands. You'll spend your time on the interesting part: why does this break, what does this show command actually tell me.

---

## Daily rhythm (both passes)

You have ~2 hours on a good day, zero on a bad day. Don't fight this — design around it.

**Good day (2 hours):**
- 90 min: CBT first, then INE for the same topic (Pass 1) or lab session (Pass 2)
- 30 min: bullet notes from memory — close the video, write what you remember

**Short day (45–60 min):**
- Watch one CBT module, write 3 bullets. If time allows, follow with the matching INE module.
- Or: Anki review only (Pass 2)

**Zero day:**
- Fine. Don't try to "catch up" the next day by doubling. Just resume where you left off.

**The only rule:** don't skip the 30-min notes pass. Writing from memory — even badly — is worth more than re-watching the same video.

---

# PASS 1 — The Map (Weeks 1–14)

**Mode:** CBT as primary. Watch the listed CBT modules first — they give you the concept, the big picture, and a quiz to self-check. Then watch the corresponding INE modules for the same topic — they go deeper into protocol mechanics and packet-level behavior. Skim the OCG chapter summary only (last section of each chapter, usually 1–2 pages). Write 3–5 bullets from memory after both videos.  
**No labs. No Anki. No deep OCG reads.**

---

**OCG skim:** Ch. 17–21 summaries (one pass through all five chapter summaries)

**Note on wireless:** This is a read-heavy week — no EVE-NG lab is realistic. In Pass 2, you'll use the Cisco DevNet 9800 Always-On sandbox for one afternoon of show-command practice. For now, just understand the architecture.

**Bullets to write:** CAPWAP split-MAC — what the AP handles locally vs what goes to the controller. L2 roaming vs L3 roaming — what's different. The 802.11 auth sequence: probe → auth → assoc → 802.1X/PSK.

**OCG skim:** Ch. 24 summary

**Note — MDT/gNMI:** Neither library covers model-driven telemetry. After the CBT modules, read OCG Ch. 24 §"Model-Driven Telemetry" (about 6 pages). Write 3 bullets. It shows up on the exam.

**Bullets to write:** SPAN vs RSPAN vs ERSPAN — what each can do that the others can't. The difference between NetFlow original and Flexible NetFlow (what you define vs what's fixed). What model-driven telemetry solves that SNMP polling doesn't.

**Bullets to write:** YANG — what it models and who reads it (management system vs device). NETCONF vs RESTCONF — transport, encoding, operations. Why Ansible is called agentless and what that means operationally.

---

## Pass 1 — End of week 14

**Self-check before starting Pass 2:**
Go through each phase topic and ask: *can I explain this to someone in 2 minutes without notes?*
- Yes on 80%+ → start Pass 2
- No on more than 3–4 topics → add a buffer week on those specific topics, then start Pass 2
- Don't add a buffer week across the board — just the weak spots

---

# PASS 2 — The Hardening (Weeks 15–24)

**Mode:** Labs are now the spine. Each topic block follows this pattern:

1. **Re-watch weak INE modules** (the ones where your Pass 1 bullets were thin)
2. **GNS3vault labs** — 2–4 labs per topic, from the `gns3vault-archive/` folder on GitHub
3. **Hand-written EVE-NG lab** — for modern topics GNS3vault doesn't cover (VXLAN, LISP, NETCONF, Ansible)
4. **OCG slow re-read** — full chapter, not just summary
5. **Notes in your own words** — include "Things I got wrong" subsection
6. **Anki cards** — build from notes, review daily

**Lab discipline:** Before looking at `final-configs/`, attempt the task list yourself. Even 40% correct is fine — the attempt is what hardens the syntax. Use `final-configs/` only as a diff, not as a cheat sheet.

---

## Pass 2 — Topic blocks

  - `show wireless summary`
  - `show ap summary`
  - `show wireless client summary`
  - `show wlan summary`
  - `show wireless mobility summary`
  - `show ap dot11 5ghz summary`
- Configure one WLAN: `wlan TEST 1 TEST-SSID`, PSK security, no shutdown

**OCG slow re-read:** Ch. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 — all five wireless chapters in full. This is the most OCG-heavy week in Pass 2 because there's no lab to carry you.

### Block 10 — Network Assurance (Week 22, second half or Week 23)

**GNS3vault labs** (`gns3vault-archive/Network Management/`):
1. `snmpv2-server` + `snmpv3-server` — back to back, compare config
2. `syslog-server-logging` + `system-message-logging` — severity, buffering, remote
3. `kron-task-scheduler` — scheduled config archive

**Hand-written EVE-NG labs:**
- Lab NA2 — *SPAN/RSPAN/ERSPAN* (original lab book — ERSPAN requires CSR1000v)
- Lab NA3 — *Flexible NetFlow + Model-Driven Telemetry* (CSR1000v — MDT via `telemetry ietf subscription`)

**OCG slow re-read:** Ch. 24

---

### Block 11 — Security (Week 23)

**Re-watch if needed:** INE `32` modules 4–7 (AAA config, CoPPr) and INE `37` (ZBFW — this is often where labs reveal gaps)

**GNS3vault labs** (`gns3vault-archive/Security/`):
1. `aaa-authentication` — RADIUS, TACACS+, local fallback
2. `aaa-command-authorization` + `aaa-exec-authorization` — privilege levels
3. `standard-access-list` → `extended-access-list` → `named-access-list` → `time-based-access-list` → `reflexive-access-list` — do all five in sequence
4. `unicast-reverse-path-forwarding-urpf` — strict vs loose mode
5. `control-place-policing` — MQC policy for control-plane
6. `basic-zone-based-firewall` — zone pairs, policy-map inspect, self zone

**GNS3vault labs** (`gns3vault-archive/Switching/`) for L2 hardening:
7. `dhcp-snooping` — trusted/untrusted ports, rate limit
8. Port-security — covered inside `ccnp-switch-lab` from Block 2 (revisit that lab's security section)

**OCG slow re-read:** Ch. 25, 26, 27, 28

---

### Block 12 — Automation (Week 24)

**Re-watch if needed:** INE `31` (NETCONF/RESTCONF) + INE `39` (programmability concepts) — these are dense and a second pass usually reveals things you missed

**Hand-written EVE-NG labs** (GNS3vault too old for these — use original lab book):
- Lab AU1 — *NETCONF/RESTCONF* (CSR1000v, Python requests, `ncclient`, verify with `show netconf-yang sessions`)
- Lab AU2 — *Ansible push* (CSR1000v + vIOS-L3 + vIOS-L2, ios_config module, inventory file, playbook)
- Lab AU3 — *EEM* (any image — applet with syslog trigger, action cli command)

**GNS3vault labs** (`gns3vault-archive/Network Management/`):
- `eem-scripting` + `eem-scripting-event-detector` — back to back with Lab AU3

**OCG slow re-read:** Ch. 29, 30

## Pass 2 — Final two weeks (Weeks 25–26)

### Week 25 — Weak-topic sprint

By now you have a clear picture of what didn't stick. This week:

- Pull your "Things I got wrong" sections from every block's notes file. Write them on a single page.
- For each item: if it's CLI — drill it in EVE-NG without config reference. If it's conceptual — re-read the OCG section and rewrite your bullet.
- Run your full Anki deck. Suspend cards you've answered correctly 5+ times. Promote cards you keep getting wrong to daily review.
- Do one GNS3vault lab from whatever domain felt weakest. No starter configs — attempt from blank topology.

### Week 26 — Integration and self-assessment

- Pick 3 random GNS3vault labs from different domains (e.g., one OSPF, one BGP, one Security). Build them from memory — no starter configs, no task list peeking for the first 30 minutes.
- For each lab you attempt: after finishing, write what you would explain differently to a junior engineer — this is your actual knowledge test.
- Read your full notes file start to finish. It should read like something you wrote, not something you copied.
- Optional: Boson ExSim practice exam, timed. If 80%+, you're at strong working knowledge. If below, add a week on the 2–3 lowest-scoring domains.

**No new material this week. Consolidation only.**

---

## Anki strategy (Pass 2 only)

- Create one card per "Things I got wrong" item — these are the highest-value cards.
- Tag cards: `encor::domain::topic` (e.g., `encor::ospf::lsa-types`)
- Review daily, 15–20 minutes maximum. This beats 90-minute weekly sessions significantly.
- Don't add cards for things you already know. Cards are for gaps, not for ego.

## What's intentionally different from the original plan

| Original plan | This plan | Why |
|---|---|---|
| CBT as sole spine | CBT first, INE second | CBT gives the big picture and self-check quizzes — ideal for first contact. INE goes Wireshark-deep — ideal once you have the concept framework. |
| Labs every week from the start | Labs only in Pass 2 | Mental model comes first. Labs are dramatically more productive when you know what you're building. |
| 10 h/week rigid schedule | Flexible — topic-based, not calendar-based | Your irregular schedule stops being a problem. If week 4 takes 10 days, nothing breaks. |
| Anki from week 1 | Anki only in Pass 2 | Memorizing something you half-understand is inefficient. Anki works on material you've already processed. |
| Single pass | Two passes | Seeing everything once at concept level, then again at depth, beats trying to go deep on first contact. |
